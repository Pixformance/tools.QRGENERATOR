this folder contains libraries used in this project:

1) AERO WIZARD 1.3.0
https://aerowizard.codeplex.com

Downloaded the sources because 1.3.0 isn't in the NuGet library yet.
Plus the published 1.3.0.0 does not contain the fix for windows 8.

move to a NuGet release when the library is fixed.

2) Zxing for C#

https://zxingnet.codeplex.com/
https://zxingnet.codeplex.com/downloads/get/732796

Removed compiled dlls for other platforms and left only the .net 4.5 one
